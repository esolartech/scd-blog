# After-Hours Calls → Morning Bookings  
**The Contractor’s Playbook for Capturing Night & Weekend Jobs**  
*Reading time: 2–3 minutes*

---

### The Problem (It’s Always After 5 PM)  
Water heaters don’t wait until Monday morning. Neither do busted furnaces, power outages, or late-night leaks.  

Customers still call after-hours — but most contractors let those rings roll straight to voicemail. And here’s the kicker: *most voicemails never become jobs.* Customers hang up, call the next company, or forget to follow through.  

**The quiet tax:**  
- 1 urgent call missed at 7:30 PM  
- $500–$800 average ticket lost  
- Multiply that over a month = thousands gone  

---

### The Shift: A Voice Agent That Never Sleeps  
Instead of “Leave a message after the beep,” imagine:  

- **Instant answer at 10:15 PM** with a friendly voice  
- **Triage for urgency** (gas, water, or electrical = flagged immediately)  
- **Capture the basics** (name, number, ZIP, quick description)  
- **Offer slots for tomorrow** or next available tech  
- **Queue it cleanly** so your team wakes up to booked jobs, not guesswork  

👉 It’s not replacing your dispatcher. It’s catching the calls when no one’s there.

### Why Owners Like It  
- **Keeps you in the game** after-hours without staffing phones  
- **Turns emergencies into bookings** instead of cancellations  
- **No more Monday surprises** — you already know who called, what they need, and where to send them  
- **Protects reputation** — customers feel cared for even at 9 PM  

---

### Moments It Quietly Wins  
- Friday night when the water heater bursts  
- Saturday morning when a breaker trips  
- Sunday evening before a snowstorm  
- Any night when your “24/7 competitor” picks up and you don’t  

---

### The Owner’s One-Liner  
> “Even when we’re closed, the agent opens tomorrow’s schedule. No more dark hours.”  

---

### ROI in Plain English  
- **Added jobs/month ≈** after-hours calls captured × book rate  
- **Added revenue/month ≈** added jobs × average ticket  

If one weekend call covers the tool, every other call is pure gain.  

---

### Objections & Calm Answers  
- *“Nobody wants AI at night.”* Wrong. They want **someone** to answer. The agent gets them scheduled or flagged fast.  
- *“We already have voicemail.”* And how many customers actually leave one? Exactly.  
- *“It’s too risky after-hours.”* Scripts keep it tight: triage → capture → schedule. Anything dangerous gets flagged, not promised.

### Try It (Low-Risk)  
Run it for 7 nights.  

- If your Monday mornings don’t feel lighter, turn it off.  
- If they do, keep it — and sleep better knowing you didn’t miss a $700 job while you rested.
