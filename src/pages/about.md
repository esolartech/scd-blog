# The History of Smart Call Decline (SCD)

## May 2025 — The spark during my MBA project

This started while I was working on my main MBA project in **May 2025**. That’s when I really saw the **power of Generative AI**—not just as a demo, but as a practical tool to redesign ugly, everyday workflows and help build software.

I pulled from two threads in my past:

* **Solar startup (≈6 years earlier):** many contractors had **no real scheduling tool**. The options felt too **expensive** or too complex for small teams.
* **Project Controls background:** I lived in **schedules and cost**. That lens made it obvious: trades businesses **need** a reliable, simple way to capture demand and route it onto a calendar.


## Early June 2025 — Field discovery with electricians

In **early June**, I started poking around with **electrical contractors**. The pattern was blunt:

* Owners and techs **pick up at the job site** (distracted, rushed) or
* They **don’t pick up**, say “I’ll call back,” or **leave the phone unattended**.

From a customer’s perspective, that’s shaky. If I’m a homeowner, I just want **acknowledgment and a slot**—not voicemail limbo.

## The first idea — SMS that “catches the miss”

I asked: *What if an SMS service automatically captured the essential info the moment a call was missed?*
The working concept:

* Detect a **missed/declined call**
* **Instant text**: “We’re on a job—can I grab a few details and get you scheduled?”
* Capture **name, phone confirm, ZIP, system type, brief problem summary**
* **Remind** the contractor to call back and **hold a window** on the calendar

It was simple, fast, and respectful of both sides: homeowners felt seen, and contractors didn’t drop leads while on a ladder.

My mentor at my previous startup encouraged me that this was a real, painful problem worth solving—and that nudge mattered.

## Early August 2025 — Leveling up to Voice Agents

By **late August**, it clicked that **Voice Agents** could handle even more:

* Answer calls with a calm, plain-English **assistant persona**
* Do the same **structured intake** as SMS
* Offer **time windows** and log a **clean timestamp** for follow-up
* Reduce the “we’ll call you back later” black hole

Voice brought **human cadence** to the flow while keeping the automation reliable.

## Why Smart Call Decline exists (and sticks)

* **Contractors are busy doing the work**; phones ring at the worst times.
* **Homeowners want certainty now**, not “maybe later.”
* **AI Voice Agents + simple ops** can bridge the gap—with **SMS and Voice** as the front door, and **a calendar** as the source of truth.

## The mentor nudge

Along the way, a mentor told me this was a **worthy problem to solve**—clear pain, measurable ROI, and a chance to give small shops big-company reliability. That encouragement helped me commit and ship.

## So that’s the journey...So Far

From MBA insight → field interviews → an **SMS catcher** → a **Voice Agent** that books and documents.
**Smart Call Decline** turns a missed ring into a **captured lead and a scheduled next step**—without asking contractors to stop doing the job they’re already on.
